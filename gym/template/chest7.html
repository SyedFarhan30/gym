        <p>The <a href="https://www.strengthlog.com/push-up/">push-up</a> is a classic bodyweight exercise for the upper body, with the benefit that you don’t need any equipment to perform it. In push-ups, you lift about 70% of your own body weight, but you can increase or decrease that amount by placing your feet or hands, respectively, on an elevation. This version of the push-up decreases the load since your hands are elevated to the sofa, chair, bench or whatever you are using. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>You can also vary the exercise by placing your hands closer och wider apart, which will transfer more of the load to the triceps or chest, respectively.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>A hidden bonus with push-ups is that you also get some static training of your core, similar to that of the plank exercise. To get even more core training, you can do your push-ups with either your hands or feet in a pair of suspended gymnastic rings or similar.</p>
