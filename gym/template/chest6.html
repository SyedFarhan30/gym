        <p>The push-up is a classic bodyweight exercise for the upper body, with the benefit that you don’t need any equipment to perform it. In push-ups, you lift about <a href="https://www.strengthlog.com/how-much-of-your-bodyweight-do-you-lift-in-a-push-up/">70% of your own body weight</a>, but you can increase or decrease that amount by placing your feet or hands, respectively, on an elevation. In <a href="https://www.strengthlog.com/kneeling-push-up/">kneeling push-ups</a>, you lift about 55% of your body weight.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>You can also vary the exercise by placing your hands closer or wider apart, which will transfer more of the load to the <a href="https://www.strengthlog.com/triceps-muscles-exercises-workout/">triceps </a>or <a href="https://www.strengthlog.com/chest-muscles-exercises-workout/">chest</a>, respectively.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>A hidden bonus with push-ups is that you also get some static training of your core, similar to that of the plank exercise. To get even more core training, you can do your push-ups with either your hands or feet in a pair of suspended gymnastic rings or similar. </p>
